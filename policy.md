# Grafana Labs bug bounty policy

## Introduction

With this bug bounty program (the “Program”) Grafana Labs aims to provide a stellar experience to security researchers and others (the “Participants”) who wish to submit reports to Grafana Labs regarding security vulnerabilities.\
To do so participants must **create a security advisory via our [dedicated GitHub page](https://github.com/grafana/tobechanged/security/advisories)**.\
As a condition to participating in the Program all Participants acknowledge and agree to the following terms and conditions:
